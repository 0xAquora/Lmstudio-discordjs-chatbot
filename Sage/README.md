#### Created with LM Studio scaffold: node-typescript

Welcome to your new project! This scaffold is a starting point for building an AI-enabled Node.js project with [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) SDK. To interact with LM Studio, you should start the LM Studio local server with the command:

```bash
lms server start
```

## Getting Started

### Development

The source code resides in the `src/` directory. For development purposes, you can run the project using:

```start
npm start
```

### Building for Production

To prepare your project for production, compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript using:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile the TypeScript code in the `src/` directory to JavaScript in the `dist/` directory.
